# About Notional

> source: [Notional Docs](https://docs.notional.finance)

## About Notional Vault Controller

> source: [Notional Developer Docs](https://docs.notional.finance/developer-documentation/how-to/leveraged-vaults#vault-controller)

A set of two contracts, `VaultAction` and `VaultAccountAction` deployed behind the Notional V2 router with full access to Notional V2 storage. These contracts are responsible for:

- Whitelisting and configuring individual strategy vault access to Notional
- Tracking total assets and debts for each strategy vault and users across maturities.
- Authentication and authorization of borrowing, withdrawals, liquidation, and settlement.

## About Notional Leveraged Vaults

> source: [Notional Developer Docs](https://docs.notional.finance/developer-documentation/how-to/leveraged-vaults)

Notional Leveraged Vaults is a framework within the Notional protocol where loans are extended to borrowers to pursue strictly defined yield strategies. In this framework, the assets in the vaults are used as collateral for the debt - this allows accounts to borrow multiples of their initial collateral deposit.

While many protocols provide yield strategy vaults, Notional has the distinct advantage of being able to offer leveraged exposure to strategy returns via fixed rate borrowing. Fixed rate borrowing significantly reduces the userâ€™s risk of liquidation or loss, allowing them to utilize higher leverage ratios and achieve greater capital efficiency.
